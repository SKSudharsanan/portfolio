As I embarked on my journey into the world of software and blockchain, I found myself surrounded by friends deeply immersed in AI projects. However, my passion, along with my friends Balaji and Neel, lay in coding. Our interest was so intense that we even created a student feedback system during our college's second year.

Coming from a college that wasn't considered a big name, we often faced questions about our skills. But we were fortunate to have some exceptional teachers like Prema, Deena, Anitha, and Sridhar who imparted excellent programming skills to us.

I must confess that I was an irregular student during my college years. In fact, I rarely attend a  class in my first two years. At one point, I contemplated discontinuing my college education and even applied to a media-based college. Everything changed when I had a life-changing encounter with the principal of Reliance AIMS. He advised me to continue my engineering journey, emphasizing its value as a golden opportunity that shouldn't be squandered. With the support of my chemistry teacher and class in-charge, Jeyamani, I returned to college, wrote my exams, and cleared them.

During my second year, I faced a severe sinus infection that left me unconscious for four days. The excruciating pain prevented me from taking my practical exams and an Environmental Science (EVS) exam, resulting in my first and only set of arrears. Despite my serious illness, I miraculously managed to clear the exams, a testament to the grace of the Almighty.

This life-altering experience prompted a shift in my college approach. I decided to dedicate more time to coding, and it was during this time that I fell in love with web programming at first sight. Together with my friends Balaji and Neel, we created a travel website about Chennai called "Chennaism." Additionally, we had the opportunity to create a feedback system (mostly to avoid attending classes).

As our third year approached, we struggled to find a suitable title for our final year project. It was during this search that we were introduced to blockchain technology by my senior, Yoganath, who was working in Japan at the time. I'm immensely grateful to Yoganath and Mohammed Abdul Kader (MAK) for their support. MAK helped me purchase my first Wi-Fi router, which turned out to be a catalyst for my project.

The word "blockchain" was nothing short of magical to me, and over the course of six-plus years, it has become one of the best things that ever happened to me. We managed to create a decentralized e-commerce system by modifying the Ethereum Pet Shop tutorial and introducing asset numbering and transfers with Ether.

And that concludes my first blog post. Stay tuned for more of my experiences in upcoming blogs!
